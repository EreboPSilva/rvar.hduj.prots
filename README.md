# Manual annotation of tardigrades Datasets


This repository provides the data derived from the manual annotation of *Ramazzottius varieornatus* and *Hypsibius dujardini* DNA reparation genes.

## Data

You can find 2 `.aa` files, each of which contains all the annotated proteins of one of the 2 species of tardigrades analysed. Also, 2 `.seq` that contains the nucleotic untrasnlated sequence of the same datasets. And lastly, 2 `.gtf`, containing the GFF3 or GTF format of the annotation.
```
  'rvar.*' -> Ramazzottius varieornatus sets
  'hduj.*' -> Hypsibius dujardini sets
```

## Reference genomes

As indicated in the publication, for the *R. varieornatus* we used the assembly [GCA_001949185.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_001949185.1/) (Rvar_4.0), while for the *H. dujardini*, the assembly was [GCA_002082055.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_002082055.1/) (nHd_3.1).
