# Comparative analysis of tardigrade genomes reveals potential mechanisms of tolerance to extreme environmental conditions


This repository provides the data derived from the manual annotation of *Ramazzottius varieornatus* and *Hypsibius dujardini* DNA reparation genes.

## Data

You can find 2 `.multifa` files, each of which contains all the annotated proteins of one of the 2 species of tardigrades analysed.
```
  'rvar.multifa' -> Ramazzottius varieornatus set of proteins
  'hduj.multifa' -> Hypsibius dujardini set of proteins
```
